    <p>
        Hi there! I'm Jasmine (she/her), and I'm a software engineering student at the University of
        Waterloo. I'm passionate about everything software and tech, from FPGAs to web development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I first learned to code in 2014, starting with Python, then Java, then a whole bunch of
        other languages. I've been using Linux as my daily driver since 2017, and I've also been
        running a home Linux server since 2018. My favourite languages are Rust and Python. In my
        free time, I like developing web apps, modding video games, and playing the piano.
