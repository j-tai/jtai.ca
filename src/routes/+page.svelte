        Hi there! I'm Jasmine (she/her), and I'm a software engineering student at the University of
        Waterloo. I'm passionate about software and tech, from FPGAs to web development.

        I learned coding in 2014, starting with Python, and later, Java. I've been using Linux as my
        daily driver since 2017. I've been running my a home Linux server since 2018, which hosts
        whatever I need. My favourite languages are Rust and Python. In my free time, I like doing
        web development and modding video games.
